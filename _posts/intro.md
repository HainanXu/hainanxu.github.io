I am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto. I obtained my M.Sc. in Statistics at the University of Toronto and my bachelor's degree from McMaster University in Mathematics and Statistics.

I am especially passionate about modelling and explaining the dynamics of the real world using mathematical/statistical models. 

Currently, I am working as a graduate research assistant under the supervision of Dr. Jun Young Park in data harmonization on neuroimaging data. Before that, I worked as an actuarial intern at the co-operators general insurance company for one year ( 8 months full-time and 4 months part-time). 

This website archives the projects that I've done, as well as my constant reflections on my career and life.
