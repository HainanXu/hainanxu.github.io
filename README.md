I am a recent graduate from the [University of Toronto][uoft]. I obtained my M.Sc. in Statistics at the University of Toronto and my bachelor's degree from [McMaster University][mac] in Mathematics and Statistics.

Currently, I am working as a graduate research assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Jun Young Park][Jun] in data harmonization on neuroimaging data. Before that, I worked as an actuarial intern at [The co-operators][coop] for one year ( 8 months co-op and 4 months part-time). 

I am especially passionate about modelling and explaining the dynamics of the real world using mathematical/statistical models. This website archives the projects that I've done, as well as my constant reflections on statistics.
